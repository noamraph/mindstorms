# Operate LEGO MINDSTORMS Inventor Hub from your computer

This module allows you to operate the LEGO mindstorms hub from
your computer. This means that instead of sending entire python
files to the hub and letting it run them, you can run the command
one after another from your computer. This allows easy experimenting
from a python shell on your computer, showing you completions and
API documentation on the way. This also allows you to use the
regular debugging facilities you're used to.

The API mirrors that of the actual micropython API, so programs that run
on the hub (and don't use callbacks) should run on your computer using this
module and vice versa.


The API documentation was copied from the official
[LEGO MINDSTORMS Inventor Hub documentation](https://lego.github.io/MINDSTORMS-Robot-Inventor-hub-API/).

Managing the actual connection to the hub is using the excellent
[rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell) project.

## Getting Started

Run:

```commandline
pip install mindstorms
```

Connect the hub to your computer using the USB cable, and then
run this from Python:

```python
from mindstorms import Hub
hub = Hub()
while True:
    while hub.motion.gesture() != hub.motion.TAPPED:
        pass
    hub.sound.play('/extra_files/Hello')
```

Tap the hub, and hear it say "hello".

## Easier usage of sensors using `spikedev`

You can use Daniel Walton's `spikedev` for easier usage of the sensors,
like this:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/noamraph/spikedev.git@sensor-support-cpython
```

```python
>>> from mindstorms import *
>>> from spikedev.sensor import *
>>> hub = Hub()
>>> color = ColorSensor(hub.port.D)
>>> color.value()
[0]
>>> dist = DistanceSensor(hub.port.E)
>>> dist.set_mode(DistanceSensorMode.DISTL)
>>> dist.value()
[58]
```

This currently relies on my pull-request. I hope it will be merged, and
then you'll be able to use it directly from his repository.

## Notes

The only missing classes from the official API are `hub.BT_VCP`
and `hub.USB_VCP`. Adding them shouldn't be too difficult, 
I just didn't know how to test them.

I added all the methods from the official API, except for those that
contains a callback.
